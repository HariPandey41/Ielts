      model: `The bar chart compares water consumption in agriculture, industry and households in three countries. Overall, agriculture was the dominant consumer in all three countries, while households used the least water. Agricultural use was highest in Country A, at 70%, followed by 65% in Country B and 60% in Country C. Industrial consumption showed the opposite pattern: it rose from 20% in Country A to 25% in Country B and 28% in Country C. Household use was relatively stable, accounting for 10% in the first two countries and 12% in the third. The figures demonstrate that the main difference between the countries concerned the balance between farming and industry. Country A was the most dependent on water for agriculture, whereas Country C had the largest industrial share. Domestic consumption remained the smallest category everywhere.` },

      model: `There are convincing arguments on both sides of this issue. In my view, a balanced approach is usually the most practical because individual circumstances and long-term social effects should both be considered.

One important argument is that policy and personal choices can produce wider benefits than are immediately visible. When people have access to useful education, reliable public services and clear information, they are more likely to make decisions that benefit themselves and their communities. For example, investment in effective public programmes can reduce future costs and create opportunities for people who would otherwise be excluded. However, opponents are right to point out that such measures can be expensive and may restrict individual choice if they are applied too rigidly.

The best solution is therefore to combine sensible public action with personal responsibility. Governments should set fair standards, provide essential support and evaluate results, while individuals and organisations should be encouraged to make informed choices. This approach avoids treating a complicated issue as if there were only one answer.

In conclusion, the advantages of a thoughtful and flexible policy outweigh the drawbacks. The most successful societies are those that protect the public interest while still allowing people enough freedom to respond to their own needs.` }
